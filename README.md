# Brentkung-adder
The Brent Kung tree adder is a logarithmic adder of low complexity.
Values of P and G are computed in a tree fashion.
First order G and P that is generate and propagate are computed.
Then second order, third order ,fourth order, fifth order and finally six order G and P computed.
All carry bits computed in a tree fashion.
This tree-like propagation of carry reduces its critical path to that of tree height.
Very fast compared to other adders.
